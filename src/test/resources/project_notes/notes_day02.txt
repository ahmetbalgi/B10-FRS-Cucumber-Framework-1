CREATING AND MANAGING BRANCHES
feel free to read the following post
or do more reading/research online
also, practice on you own framework, don't be afraid to break
everything, it is better if you break now, rather than at work

Building my Framework structure based on POM and Cucumber principles

on JAVA level,
	right click on Java
	New -> Package
	name: com.cybertek.pages		(per POM)

	right click on Java
	New -> Package
	name: com.cybertek.utilities 	(per POM)

	right click on Java
	New -> Package
	name: com.cybertek.runners		(per Cucumber)

	right click on test
	New -> Directory
	name: resources					(per Cucumber)

	right click on resources folder that you just created
	Mark Directory as -> Test Resources Root

	right click on resources
	New -> Directory

Adding our high level configuration.properties file
on PROJECT level
    right click on B10-FRS-Cucumber-Framework
    New -> File
    name: configuration.properties


<<< IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ >>>
THIS IS NOT A COMMON PRACTICE, but if you want to keep your notes within your project
you can simply create files in resources and do as you wish.

This is how WE did it:
    right click on resources
    New -> Directory
    name: project_notes

    THEN: every time you want a new file in this project_notes
    right click on project_notes
    New -> File
    name: uptoyou.whatever (store it as .txt if prompted)
